              p it has taken some time for the term to be recognized
                |by an actual definition used by dictionary, legal, and crime
                |prevention sources. Cybercrime is now defined as any criminal
                |offense that is facilitated by, or involves the use of,
                |electronic communications or information systems, including
                |any electronic device, computer, or the internet.

            p The term homicide simply refers to any act that caused or
              |resulted in the death of a person. This is different from
              |something the decedent did which resulted in his own death,
              |such as falling off a tall building. However, if the decedent
              |had been arguing with a co-worker on the roof, and the two
              |began a shoving match, which caused him to fall off the tall
              |building, the death would be considered a homicide. Still, it
              |isnâ€™t necessarily murder, as circumstances may dictate that it
              |was an accident after all.

            p There is no universal definition as to just what acts are
              |considered terrorism, but it is commonly considered to be an
              |action that causes fear and/or harm for a political,
              |ideological, religious, or economic objective. Acts of
              |terrorism deliberately target civilians, neutral military
              |personnel, or other non-combatants, with blatant disregard for
              |their safety. To explore this concept, consider the following
