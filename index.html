                  <h2>Cyber Crime</h2>
                  <p>
                    When Della’s boyfriend Rob, and his friend Steve, begin holding
                    “private” meetings in the couple’s basement, she knows something
                    is up. A few weeks later, Rob comes home in a rush, ...
                  </p>
                  <!-- <p>hauling a couple of heavy bags down the basement steps.
                            Worried, Della follows him down, to see a huge amount of cash in the bags, as Rob worked frantically to stuff it all
                            into a hole in the wall behind the heating unit. Deciding she doesn’t want to know, Della just pushes it out of her
                            mind.
                            
                            A couple of weeks later, the police come to Della’s door, wanting to talk to her. When they tell her they have evidence
                            that Rob committed a bank robbery recently, she acts shocked, and denies knowing anything about it. The truth is, she
                            has suspected as much the day he brought the cash home, but has been reluctant to say something. Rob has ensured her a
                            $100,000 cut of the money, and she would hate for the authorities to carry it all away.
                            
                            Throughout the investigation, in this example of aiding and abetting, Della denies any involvement with, or even
                            knowledge of the crime. Della, by her actions (or failure to tell what she knows), is aiding and abetting her
                            boyfriend’s crime.</p> -->

                  <h2>Terror</h2>
                  <p>
                    On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four airplanes in the
                    U.S. After taking over the planes, the group flew two of them into
                    the World Trade Center in ...
                  </p>
                  <!-- <p>
                              New York City, hitting two buildings, causing them to catch fire and collapse. A third plane flew toVirginia, and crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth plane, believed to be headed to the White House,
                              crashed before it could reach its goal, as passengers onboard the plane fought the terrorists, taking the plane off
                              course.
                              
                              The terrorists, 19 in total, were from the Middle East and belonged to Al Qaeda, a well-known terrorist group led by
                              Osama Bin Laden. The group practices Islam on an extremist basis, and is opposed to the democratic nations of the world,
                              including the United States. After the planes crashed into their target buildings, America responded by digging through
                              the rubble in order to find survivors. Nearly 3,000 people, most of them U.S. citizens, died in the attacks.
                              
                              The United States quickly declared war on the terrorist group Al Qaeda. In October of 2001, the United States and its
                              allies invaded Afghanistan, where the Taliban government allowed Al Qaeda to maintain its base. The forces quickly began
                              hunting down members of the terrorist group, capturing and killing the terrorists. On May 1, 2011, U.S. troops were
                              finally able to locate the leader, Osama Bin Laden, in Pakistan. Bin Laden was killed in the attack.
